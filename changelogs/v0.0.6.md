# CHANGELOG

## v0.0.6

This release contains some new features and fixes to logic of existing functionality.

### New Features

- Features to file Uuid Management. Now `DirectoryEntry` has a `uuid` field. Check the response from `UserStorage.listDirectory`.
  
- New method [`UserStorage.openFileByUuid`](https://fleekhq.github.io/space-sdk/docs/sdk.userstorage.openfilebyuuid) can be used 
  to open a file exclusively by its uuid. Note: uuid would throw an error if current SpaceUser is not authorized to access the file.
  
- New method [`UserStorage.txlSubscribe`]((https://fleekhq.github.io/space-sdk/docs/sdk.userstorage.txlsubscribe)) can be used to subcribe
to textile bucket events as user interacts with their bucket.


### New Fixes

- More secure and privacy fix around users buckets. Now everyn users bucket has a different thread id.
Making it more similar to space-daemon.
